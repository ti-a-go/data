Editors of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia tend to update Wikipedia articles with information about deaths quickly after people die. Web developer and Wikipedia editor Hay Kranen coined the term "deaditor" to refer to these editors. Articles about people often have large spikes in views just after they die. For example, the article about designer Kate Spade averaged 2,117 views in 48-hour periods before her death. In the 48 hours after her death, it got 3,417,416, an increase of 161,427%.The media have remarked on the site's quick updates after the deaths of people such as Michael Jackson and Elizabeth II.In 2009, English-language Wikipedia adopted new quality control measures to verify information on the biographies of living people, including claims of death.When a biographee dies of a disease, the progress of that disease may also be described.
