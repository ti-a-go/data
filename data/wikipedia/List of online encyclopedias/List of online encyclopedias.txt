This is a list of well-known online encyclopedias—i.e., encyclopedias accessible or formerly accessible on the Internet.
The largest online encyclopedias are general reference works, though there are also many specialized ones. Some online encyclopedias are editions of a print encyclopedia, such as Encyclopædia Britannica, whereas others have always existed online, such as Wikipedia.
